# Face-Mask-Detection

  The goal is to predict whether the person is wearing Face Mask or not using Deep Learning. Here I used the concept of Transfer Learning. I used ResNet50 model to predict the images. The model is deployed using Flask App.

# Data Set

  Trained and Tested the model on Face Mask Data Set, which contains images of people both wearing mask and with out mask. The data set contains 1194 images belonging to 2 classes, used as training set and 244 images belonging to 2 classes used as validation set.
